Sure, let's create another class `FactorialWithHelperMethods` that calculates the factorial of a given integer. This class will use helper methods to make the code more modular and easier to understand. I'll include comments to highlight the changes and improvements.

### Pseudocode:
1. Define the class `FactorialWithHelperMethods`.
2. Create a private field [`number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%220b1c7d1f-749e-4f6f-bd40-fda3d54ee768%22%5D "Go to definition") to store the input number.
3. Implement a constructor to initialize the [`number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%220b1c7d1f-749e-4f6f-bd40-fda3d54ee768%22%5D "Go to definition").
4.

    public void setNumber(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    // Public method to calculate factorial
    public int calculateFactorial() {
        return factorial(number); // Call the helper method
    }

    // Private helper method to perform the factorial calculation
    private int factorial(int n) {
        int result = 1; // Initialize initial value to 1
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Loop from 1 to n
            result *= i; // Multiply result by i to calculate the factorial
        }
        return result; // Return the factorial
    }
}

### Changes and Improvements:
- **Modularity**: The factorial calculation logic is moved to a private helper method [`factorial`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A66%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A66%7D%7D%5D%2C%220b1c7d1f-749e-4f6f-bd40-fda3d54ee768%22%5D "Go to definition"), making the code more modular.
- **Readability**: By separating the calculation logic into a helper method, the [`calculateFactorial`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F18057%2FLocalDesktop%2FCuesta%2FCuestaFall2024%2FCis232%2FRevisionTwo%2Fsrc%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialNoInterface.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%220b1c7d1f-749e-4f6f-bd40-fda3d54ee768%22%5D "Go to definition") method becomes simpler and easier to read.
- **Reusability**: The helper method can be reused or modified independently without affecting the public interface of the class.

You can further extend this approach by adding more helper methods if needed, for example, to handle edge cases or to optimize the calculation for large numbers.
