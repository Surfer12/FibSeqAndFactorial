This iterative approach correctly calculates the factorial of the given number. For example, if [`inputNumber`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2FCis232Decoupled%2FRecursionSortingProject%2Fsrc%2FAssignment%2FFactorial%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialIterationMethods.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2FCis232Decoupled%2FRecursionSortingProject%2Fsrc%2FAssignment%2FFactorial%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialIterationMethods.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%2278d129ab-ecdb-4bd1-b924-4f53cb93c9e3%22%5D "Go to definition") is 5, the method will compute `5!` as `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`.

Here is a simple test to verify the correctness:

```java
public class TestFactorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FactorialIterationMethods factorial = new FactorialIterationMethods(5);
        System.out.println(factorial.computeFactorial()); // Output should be 120
    }
}
```

This test should output `120`, confirming that the factorial computation is correct.
