Sure, I'll restructure the [`FactorialALt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2FCis232Decoupled%2FRecursionSortingProject%2Fsrc%2FAssignment%2FFactorial%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialALt.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22987a154a-7cc5-43bc-bc1a-0c9de483a7d4%22%5D "Go to definition") class to make it more readable and self-documenting through the use of descriptive variable names and method signatures.

### Original Code
```java
public class FactorialALt {
   private int number;

   // Constructor to initialize the number
   public FactorialALt(int number) {
      this.number = number;
   }

   // Getter method for number
   public int getNumber() {
      return number;
   }

   // Setter method for number
   public void setNumber(int number) {
      this.number = number;
   }

   // Public method to calculate factorial
   public int calculateFactorial() {
      return factorial(number); // Call the helper method
   }

   // Private helper method to perform the factorial calculation
   private int factorial(int n) {
      int result = 1; // Initialize initial value to 1
      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Loop from 1 to n
         result *= i; // Multiply result by i to calculate the factorial
      }
      return result; // Return the factorial
   }
}
```

### Restructured Code
```java
package Assignment.Factorial.FactorialClasses;

public class FactorialCalculator {
    private int inputNumber;

    public FactorialCalculator(int inputNumber) {
        this.inputNumber = inputNumber;
    }

    public int getInputNumber() {
        return inputNumber;
    }

    public void setInputNumber(int inputNumber) {
        this.inputNumber = inputNumber;
    }

    public int computeFactorial() {
        return computeFactorialIteratively(inputNumber);
    }

    private int computeFactorialIteratively(int number) {
        int factorialResult = 1;
        for (int currentMultiplier = 1; currentMultiplier <= number; currentMultiplier++) {
            factorialResult *= currentMultiplier;
        }
        return factorialResult;
    }
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Class Name**: Changed from [`FactorialALt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2FCis232Decoupled%2FRecursionSortingProject%2Fsrc%2FAssignment%2FFactorial%2FFactorialClasses%2FFactorialALt.java%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22987a154a-7cc5-43bc-bc1a-0c9de483a7d4%22%5D "Go to definition") to `FactorialCalculator` to better reflect its purpose.
